from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('projects/', include('projects.urls')),
    path("blog/", include("blog.urls")),
]

"""
There are now two full URLs that can be accessed with our project:
    - localhost:8000/projects: The project index page
    - localhost:8000/projects/3: The detail view for the project with pk=3
