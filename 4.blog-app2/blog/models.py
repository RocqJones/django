"""
-> SLUG: This is a field intended to be used in URLs. It contains only letters, numbers, underscores, 
or hyphens.
- You will use the slug field to build beautiful, SEO-friendly URLs for your blog posts.
  * You have added the unique_for_date parameter to this field so that you can build URLs for posts using 
  their publish date and slug.
  * Django will prevent multiple posts from having the same slug for a given date.

-> author: This field defines a many-to-one relationship, meaning that each post is written by a user, 
and a user can write any number of posts.

-> The Meta class inside the model contains metadata. You tell Django to sort results by the publish 
field in descending order by default when you query the database.

-> The __str__() method is the default human-readable representation of the object. Django will use it in 
many places, such as the administration site.
